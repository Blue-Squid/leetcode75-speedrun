# The LeetCode 75 Speed Run

## Introduction

LeetCode has become the go-to platform for aspiring software engineers and developers looking to prepare for technical interviews. With its extensive collection of coding problems, it offers an excellent opportunity to hone your algorithmic and data structure skills. Among the many ways to use LeetCode effectively, one approach that has gained popularity is the "LeetCode 75 Study plan." In this repo, we will attempt to complete the 75 problems in 48 hours. 


## What is the LeetCode 75 Speed Run?

The LeetCode 75 Speed Run is a focused and time-efficient approach to mastering coding interviews. The number "75" refers to the target number of problems you aim to solve, specifically chosen to cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels. The idea is to tackle these 75 problems within a set time frame, to ensure that you develop a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms while improving your problem-solving skills. Also flexing on noobs. 

## Why 75?

The number 75 is not arbitrary; it is carefully selected to ensure a balanced and comprehensive preparation. Here's the breakdown of the significance of this number:

*Diversity:* 75 problems cover a broad spectrum of topics, including arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more. This diversity ensures that you're well-equipped to handle a variety of interview questions.

*Depth:* While there are many more problems on LeetCode, completing 75 problems forces you to dive deep into each one. You'll understand the nuances of different problem-solving techniques, enabling you to tackle similar problems with ease.

*Time Efficiency:* The LeetCode 75 Speed Run is designed to be completed within a few days, making it an achievable goal for candidates with busy schedules.

## Rules:
1. Stealing solutions from other sources is not allowed.
2. All solutions must be correct and must pass all the tests.
3. If you're stuck or unable to solve a problem, researching the problem in discussions, forums, stackoverflow, textbooks, youtube, reddit is allowed but the actual code grabbing and blatant plagerism is not allowed.
4. Cite sources if solution comes above resources.
5. If 48 hours have been passed since begining the speed run, and all 75 solutions are not completed then *you lose automatically*.
6. Code can be written in any language of your choice. (I am using C++) 

Note: Timer starts when you clone this repo. 
Note: Solution need not be optimal, or efficient only correctness is required.  

## Why the LeetCode 75 Speed Run Works:

_Structured Learning:_ It provides a structured approach to cover essential topics, preventing you from getting lost in the vast sea of LeetCode problems.

_Balanced Coverage:_ The selection of problems ensures that you become proficient in a wide range of topics, which is vital for interviews.

_Time Management:_ By setting a time frame for completing these problems, you develop time management skills, a valuable asset during interviews.

_Problem Solving:_ The repetition and review of problems sharpen your problem-solving abilities, enabling you to tackle unknown challenges effectively.
## Conclusion

The LeetCode 75 Speed Run is a well-defined strategy to prepare for technical interviews efficiently. By completing 75 carefully chosen problems, you can master a diverse set of coding challenges, build confidence, and become better equipped to excel in coding interviews. Remember that while speed is important, understanding the underlying concepts and techniques is equally crucial. So, embark on your LeetCode 75 Speed Run journey, and watch your coding interview skills reach new heights.
